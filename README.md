This repository demonstrates a common error in C++: attempting to `delete` a variable that wasn't allocated using `new`.  The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code. The corrected version is in `bugSolution.cpp`. The error results in undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes or memory corruption.  Always ensure that you only `delete` pointers that point to memory allocated using `new` (or `new[]` for arrays).
